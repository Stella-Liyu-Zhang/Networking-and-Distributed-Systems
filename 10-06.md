## Protocols

- Explicit and implicit conventions for
  how to communicate
- Not for what is communicated
- Enables heterogeneous architectures,
  languages, OSes, byte ordering, ...

## WHERE DO PROTOCOLS COME FROM?

- Standards bodies
  - IETF: Internet Engineering Task
    Force
  - ISO: International Standards
    Organization
- Community efforts
  - “Request for comments”
  - Bitcoin
- Corporations/industry
  - RealAudioTM, Call of Duty
    multiplayer, Skype

## HOW ARE PROTOCOLS SPECIFIED?

- Prose/BNF
- State transition diagrams
- Message Sequence Diagram
- Packet formats

### Operation (e.g., in a voting system)

- An action you can perform within a protocol’s service interface
- E.g., “Submit vote”, “get current vote count”, “reset vote count
  to zero”

### Message

- An encoding of an operation according to a protocol’s wire
  format. Common formats include XML, binary, JSON, ...

### Framing

- Writing out (and reading in) messages from a stream such that
  messages can be separated and interpreted correctly

### Parsing/encoding/decoding

- Converting a message to/from an application data structure

## Binary representation of name?

- Handling variable length
- Consider “Alan” as a name
- Option 1: Explicit length
  - But how big should length be?
- Option 2: Delimiter
  - But what if delimiter is in the message?

> Cannot include the delimiter in the message
> Use the ascii code representing zero to represent zero

> Messages grouped out into smaller pieces;
> send a protocol message > 64 bytes
>
> TCP layer is passing IP packets down in the IP layer, need to break down into smaller pieces
> On the receiver

## Framing:

- Finds and returns bytes
  corresponding to single message
- Even if messages are variable
  length
- Writes out bytes corresponding
  to a message with enough
  context for the other side to
  determine the message
  boundaries

## Framing Scenario

Consider a voting scenario

- Each message is variable length
- “Voting v 134”  [Vote for candidate 134]

“Voting i 19381”

-  [Query candidate 19381’s vote count]
- First is 12 characters, second is 14 characters

> Given a stream of vote operations, how to
> separate them?

## Framing choices

- Delimiter (in this case ‘$’)

```
Voting v 134$Voting v 2817$Voting i
9172651$Voting v 2$Voting i 1900$Voting v
32$Voting i 8
```

- Length + message

```
12Voting v 13413Voting v 281716Voting i
917265110Voting v 213Voting i 190011Voting v
3210Voting i 8
```

## The main loop of your server

```go
Remaining := “”
buf := make([]byte, 1024)
for {
for {
// Does remaining contain a full request?
// If yes,(1) parse it, then (2) remove from remaining

}
size, err := c.Read(buf)
data := buf[:size]
remaining = remaining + string(data)
}
//How do you know when a request is completed?
```

> The amount of users is limited by the performance of my application

## How to tell if buffer contains a complete request?

- This is the framing problem

## Framing Summary

### Writing data

- Given an array of bytes
  representing an application-level
  operation, writes to stream

1. Explicit length
   - Writes out the length of the
     message, then message
2. Delimiter
   - Ensures delimiter doesn’t
     appear in message
   - Writes out message
   - Then writes out delimiter

### Reading data

Reads from stream until entire
message is read, returns to higher
layer

1. Explicit length
   - Reads the length, then reads
     that many bytes (security?)
2. Delimiter
   - Reads continuously into a
     buffer until delimiter is
     encountered
   - Message then returned to
     higher layer

## Example demo

go run turing-sender.go

```go
package main

import(
    "flag"
    "strconv"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "log"
    "strings"
)

func main(){
    //read the file in integer
    port := flag.Int("port", 3333, "Port to connect to")
    host := flag.String("host", "127.0.0.1", "Host ot IP to connect to")
    delim := flag.String("delimiter", "/", "The delimiter to use")
    flag.Parse()

    c, err := net.Dial("tcp",*host + ":" + strconv.Itoa(*port))
    if err != nil{
        log.Panicln(err)
    }
    defer c.Close()

    log.Println("Connected to server")

    remaining := ""
    buf := make([]byte, 10)


    for {
        for strings.Contains(remaining, *delin){
            index := strings.Index(remaining, *delim)
            fmt.Println(remaining[:idx])
            remaining = remaini ng[indx+1:]
        }
        size, srr := c.Read(buf)
        if err != nil{
            break
        }

        data := buf[:size]
        remaining = remaining + string(data)
    }
    log.Printn("Program ended with remaining = ")
}



```

```go

```
