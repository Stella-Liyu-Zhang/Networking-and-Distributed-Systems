### The Go Programming Language (Donovan &

Kernighan)

- Arrays (4.1) and/or Maps (4.3)

  - So you can find server x’s net.Conn object when you need to send data to server x

- Go routines and channels (Chapter 8)
  - For each of the (N-1) other servers, you will need a goroutine
    waiting for and receiving data from that particular server
  - As each of those goroutines receive data, they’ll have to
    communicate that data back to the main goroutine via a channel
- You do not need mutexes or anything from chapter 9

## Initialization (Client and Server)

```go
int sock = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, ());
if(sock < 0){
    perror("socket() failed");
    abort();
}
```

- socket(): returns a socket descriptor
- AF_INET: IPv4 address family
  - C.f IPv6 => AF_INET6
- SOCK_STREAM: streaming socket type
  - C.f SOCK_DGRAM
- perror(): prints out an error message

```go
struct sockaddr_in sin;
memset( &sin, 0, sizeof(sin));
sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
sin.sin_Addr.sr_addr = INADDR_ANY;
sin.sin_port = htons(server_port);

if (bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *) &sin, sizeof(sin)) < 0>){
    perror("bind failed");
    abort();
}

```

- `bind()`: binds a socket with a particular port number
  - kernel remebers which process has bound which port
  - Only one process can bind a particular port number at a time
- `struct sockaddr_in`: ipv4 socket address structure (c.f., struct sockaddr_in6)
- `INADDR_ANY`: if server has multiple IP addresses, binds any address
- `htons()`: converts host byte order into network byte order

## Endianess

Q) You have a 16-bit number: 0x0A0B. How is it stored in memory?

- Host byte order is not uniform

  - Some machines are Big endian, others are Little endian

- Communicating between machines with different host byte orders is
  problematic

  - Transferred $256 (0x0100), but received $1 (0x0001)

- For Internet, we standardize on big-endianness
  - htons() and ns

```
Increasing address ----> Big Endian
0x0A 0x0B
0x0B 0x0A
Inxreasing address ----> Little Endian


```

- Network byte order: Big endian
  - To avoid the endian problem
- We must use network byte order when sending 16bit, 32bit
  , 64bit numbers.
- Utility functions for easy conversion

- uint16_t htons(uint16_t host16bitvalue);
- uint32_t htonl(uint32_t host32bitvalue);
- uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t net16bitvalue);
- uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t net32bitvalue);

> Hint: h, n, s, and l stand for host byte order, network byte order,
> short(16bit), and long(32bit), respectively

## Initialization, server via listen()

- socket is active by default
- We need to make it passive to get connections

```go
if (listen (sock, back_log) < 0>){
    perror("listen failed");
    abort();
}
```

- `listen()`: converts an active socket to passive
- `back_log`: connection-waiting queue size (eg 32)

  - Busy server may need a larget value (eg, 1024)

- active socket: client side, waiting for connection,
- passive socket: only call listen to become passive, so that we could get connections

## Connection Establishment (on the client)

```go
struct sockaddr_in sin;
memset(&sin, 0, sizeof(sin));

sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
sin.sin_Addr.s_addr = inet_addr("128.32.132.214");
sin.sin_port = htons(80);

// send over the network
if(connect (sock, (struct sockaddr *) &sin, sizeof(sin)) < 0){
    perror("connection failed");
    abort();
}
```

- `Connect()`: waits unti connection establishes/fails

- `inet_Addr()` : converts an IP Address string into a 32 bit address number (network byte order).

## Connection Establishment (on the server)

```go
struct sockaddr_in client_sin;
int addr_len = sizeof(client_sin);

int client_sock = accept(listening_sock, (struct sockaddr *) &client_sin,
&addr_len);

if (client_sock < 0) {
    perror(“accept failed”);
    abort();
}
```

- `accept()`: returns a new socket descriptor for a client connection
  in the connection-waiting queue.
  - This socket descriptor is to communicate with the client
  - The passive socket (listening_sock) is not to communicate with a client

## 5-tuple

## Sending data (both client and server)

```go
char *data_addr = “hello, world”;
int data_len = 12;
int sent_bytes = send(sock, data_addr, data_len, 0);
if (sent_bytes < 0) {
perror(“send failed”);
}
```

- `send()`: sends data, returns the number of sent bytes
  - Also OK with `write(), writev()`
- `data_addr`: address of data to send
- `data_len`: size of the data
- With blocking sockets (default), send() blocks until it sends all the data.
- With non-blocking sockets, `sent_bytes` may not equal to `data_len`
  - If kernel does not have enough space, it accepts only partial data
  - You must retry for the unsent data

## Receiving data (both client and server)

```go
char buffer [4096];
itn expected_data_len = sizeof(buffer);

int read_bytes = recv(sock, buffer, expected_data_len, 0);
if (read_bytes == 0) { // connection is closed
...
} else if (read_bytes < 0) { // error
perror(“recv failed”);
} else { // OK. But no guarantee read_bytes == expected_data_len
...
}
```

- `recv()`: reads bytes from the socket and returns the number of read bytes.

  - Also OK with `read() ` and `readv()`

- `read_bytes` may not equal to `expected_data_len`
  - If no data is available, it blocks
  - If only partial data is available, read_bytes < expected_data_len
  - On socket close, expected_data_len equals to 0 (not error!)
  - If you get only partial data, you should retry for the remaining portion.

## Closing connection (both client and server)

```GO
//after use the socket
close(sock);
```

- `close()`: closes the socket descriptor

We cannot open files/sockets more than 1024\*

- We must release the resource after use
