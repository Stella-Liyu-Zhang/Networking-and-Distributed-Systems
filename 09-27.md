layer 4 TCP
layer 3 IP TCP

TCP/IP model
only look at the bottom 2 layers
forwarding packets within one subnetwork

## Addressing

1. Implementing a client application

- communcatie within a remote system/service via its IP Address

2. Implement a cloud-hosted network service

- be assigend a subnet of IP Addresses to use for your various sever programs, and will need to use and mange those appropraitely
  > data center remotely
  >
  > web browser: make multiple connections to different server that stores JS files, images, etc
  > multiple clients

### IP Protocol

Scenario: An internet connected device wants to send a message to another Internet connected device in the world

- IP protocol handles this
- Prepend an "IP header" ot the message, set the destination IP Address, set the source IP address, and internet routers wil forward it along the shortes path till it gets to the destination network
- FROM HERE, THE DESTINATION NETWORK FORWARDS THE PACKET TO THE INTTENDED HOST

### IP Version 4

> 192. 168 . 1. 10 (Decimal)

- 32 bits
- represneted as four 8-bit bytes
- Eg. 206.209.1.6, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.10

### IP Version 6

- 128 bits
- Represented as 8 160bit blocks, in hexadecimal, separated by colons
- Zeros could be ommitted
  > Ex:

## The Internet: A network of Sub-networks

Each network is assigned one or more groups of contiguous IP addresses and ohosts within that network are assigned IP addresss from that range/pool

> how many addresses in the block? 256
>
> eg. UCSD: 206.109.1.1 through 206.109.1.255

## Route Aggregation

- 2^32 possible (IPv4) addresses spread across ~100,000 independent networks
- Each router keeps the "next hop" on a per-network basis, not per-host basis
- But network can be different sizes
- Each router has to keep a list of networks (And their next hops) + how big each network is

## Class-based addressing (not used anymore)

- Most significant bits determines "class" of address
- Special addresses
  - class D(1110) for multicast, ckass E (1111) experimental
  - 127.0.01: locak host
  - Host bits all set to 0: network address
  - Host bits all set to 1: broadcast address

> 16M hosts per network

### Addressing example

## IP Address problem (1991)

- Address space depletion
  - In danger of running out of class A and B
- Why?
  - Class C too small for most organizations
  - vEry few class A -very careful about

## CIDR

classless inter-domain routing (1993)

- Networks nescribed by variable-length prefix and length
- Allows arbitrary allocation between network and host address
- eg. 10.95.1.2 contained within 10.0.0/8
- Pro: finer grained allocation; aggregation
- Con: More expensive lookup: longest prefix match

  206.109.30/24: first 24 bits representing the network

  > 32: bits in total, including bits for both the host and the network
  >
  > 2^(32-24) = 256

## Address Aggregation Example

22 bits in common

## PORTS

- IP address identify as a machine
  - Actually they aidentify a network interface on a machine
- How to identify different programs on the machine?
  - Process ID/PID
  - Instead we use a port (16-bit number)
  - 0-1024 reserved for the OS, you can use 1025-65535

> PID could change

- Port 80 (HTTP) vs. Port 443 (HTTPS):

## Network address translation

Network address translation

- remember the 10.0.0.3,
- process is going to rewrite the destination address to a one that maps to it

## Load balancing via network address translation
