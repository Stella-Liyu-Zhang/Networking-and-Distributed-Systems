Goroutines

- A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution
-

Channels

- pipes that connect concurrent goroutines
- Send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine
- By defautl sends and receives block until both the sender and receiver are ready -Synchronization

> - Create a channel:
>   `make(chan val-type)`
> - Send a value into a channel: `channel<- val`
> - Receive a value from the channel : `val := <- channel`

Build socket mesh

- read the input file
- Partition the records
- Send relevant records to peer servers
- Receive records from peers
- Sort the merged data
- Write the sorted data to a single per-server output file

Each process will start up at slightly different tmes, need to make sure to keep retrying your net.Dail() calls until all the sockets are set up

- One way of doing that is to include your calls in a loop, and to retry the net.Dial() call after a short delay (eg 250 milliseconds)
- `time.Sleep(250*yime.Millisecond)`

main.go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
)

func listenForData(ch  chan <- string, cType string, host string, port string){
    l, err := net.Listen (cType, host+":" + port)
    if err!=nil {
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    for{
        conn, err:= l.Accept()
        if err != nil{
            return
        }
        fmt.Println("Client" + conn.RemoteAddr().String() + "connected.")
        go handleConnection (conn, ch)
    }
}

func handleConnection(conn net.Conn, ch chan <- string){
    buf := make([]byte, 100)
    bytes, err := conn.Read(buf)
    if err != nil{
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    greeting := string (buf[0 : bytes])
    ch <- greeting
}

func consolidateServerData(ch <- chan string, numberOfClients int){
    numOfClientsCompleted := 0
    for {
        //receive all the greetings from clients
        if numOfClientsCompleted == numOfClients{
            break
        }
        message := <- ch
        fmt.Println(message)
        numOfClientsCompleted ++
    }
}
func main(){
    //Read server configs
    host := os.Args[1]
    port := os.Args[2]

    //listen on a socket
    ch:= make(chan string)
    defer close(ch)
    go listenForData( ch, "tcp", host, port)

    //send data, using an extra channel
    //another go routine

    //consolidate data
    // will block until all data has been received
    numOfClients := 7
    consolidateServerData (ch, numOfClients)

    //make sure your data is sent and you received all the data from other servers, then exit


}

```

```go
go build -o main main.go
//server, port, waiting for the data
./main localhost 8080
```

client side:

```go
./client.sh
```
